# Staunton, VA Minecraft Map
Work in progress map of the entirety of Staunton, Virginia. I work on the map pretty much daily and *should*(tm) post updates here, as they happen.

## FAQ
### Any tools?
I use mods for bulk-editing, but the only computer-generated part of the world is the roads. All buildings are built by hand using coordinates and ratios for scale.

### Why?
Because I can. Also for the Build The Earth project.
