# Staunton, VA Minecraft Map
Work in progress map of the entirety of Staunton, Virginia. I work on the map pretty much daily and *should*(tm) post updates here, as they happen. If anything looks incredibly wrong/off-axis, that's because it is. Perfection is not our goal right now, but rather to have the foundation laid and to be able to explore it before perfecting it using math and world editing tools.

## FAQ
### Any tools?
I use mods for bulk-editing, but the only computer-generated part of the world is the roads. All buildings are built by hand using coordinates and ratios for scale.

### Why?
See: Build The Earth project - though I started this project before that had been announced.
